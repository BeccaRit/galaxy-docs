# Introduction

Welcome to the Visit Galaxy API Reference. If you donâ€™t have an API key, get in touch with us.

The API gives you access to some of the citybreak functionaility, enabling you to search for products, get content, search availability and use shopping baskets for booking and generating pay-later invoices.

This documentation is too long? You can check out the <a href="https://galaxy.test.citybreak.com">Swagger UI</a>. It targets test data and you can request a test API key for internal products that you can make bookings and do availability searches for. Give it a try and come back later.

The live Galaxy API is accessible here: <a href="https://galaxy.citybreak.com">https://galaxy.citybreak.com</a>
